              The best things in life are worth waiting for...  
              </span>
              That’s what I’ve always been told, and I suppose there is truth in that.  I am a native Floridian and have worked on a family farm much of my life in central Florida.  Mostly because it was a way to make a living; however, I still found satisfaction in it.  It has been several years since I last farmed "full-time", but I've managed to plant something in a patch of dirt nearly every year since then. I guess you could say that I have dirt in my veins.</p>

              <p>I get fired up when you start talking about produce.  I love those road-side, pop-up markets (you know, the here today gone tomorrow ones). I have always wanted my own produce market.  Fresh is best, and the fresher, the better.  My goal is to carry as much locally-grown produce as I can. You have my word that everything you find in my market will be as fresh as it can possibly be.  I select the best for you and your family, just as I would select for me and mine.</p>

              <p>We will be here today, and tomorrow to provide the freshest fruits and vegetables for you.</p>
